Show and Tell Cheatsheet
========================

These apply to:

- bottles - initial exercise
- house - initial shameless green exercise

---

- Did you finish? In other words, are the tests all passing? (If not, your
  solution is too complicated)
- Did you find this exercise easy or hard?
- Are you proud or embarrassed about your code? (It's okay to be embarrassed.)
- Is your code understandable (would it pass the inebriation test?)
- Is this solution more complicated or simpler than the previous one?
- How did you decide what code to write? (I saw a pattern and I went there. What
  if you don't see a pattern?)
- What force drove you to make these decisions?
- For production, would it look like this?
- Is there complexity here that the tests did not force you to implement? Did
  you write more code than the tests require?
- Did you get *all* the tests passing before you started making extra methods?
